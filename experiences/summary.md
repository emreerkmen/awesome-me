As a 5 years experienced senior software engineer, my expertise in designing microservice-based REST APIs using Java with Spring MVC and Spring Boot frameworks, Golang with Gorilla Mux library, and tools like Postman has resulted in the deployment of efficient and fault-tolerant systems. I have a proven track record of developing reusable, high-quality, and secure code while implementing unit tests. I have successfully managed projects utilizing Agile Scrum methodology, leading to improved efficiency and estimation accuracy. My experience with technologies such as React JS, Docker, and Openshift has allowed me to build scalable and performant web applications while maintaining JBoss and Apache web servers on Linux. Additionally, I have mentored developers, reviewed code, and collaborated with teams to develop new features and functionality while using Confluence and SourceTree for collaboration.
